Operation Shadow Veil - Code Red

Agent 47,

You are to initiate Phase 1 of Operation Shadow Veil immediately. Time is of the essence, and the window for success is narrowing. Here are the encrypted directives:

    Location: Station Delta
    Coordinates locked. Your contact will meet you in the alley at 03:00 hours. Ensure your face remains concealed, even under the dim streetlight. The person you meet will have an emblem—a crescent moon—and will hand over the black envelope. Inside, you’ll find the microchip with the intel. Do not open it until you're alone.

    Phase 2: The Intercept
    At 07:00 hours, you will need to breach the communications tower at North Ridge, ensuring the signal is redirected to our network. Avoid detection by Agency 9. They’ve planted a mole inside our circle, and they are watching all routes. Trust no one. Proceed to door 3B; it's the only access point not under surveillance.

    Phase 3: Rendezvous with Raven
    The drop point for the final package is at Milford Harbor, behind the old warehouse with the faded red logo. Raven will be waiting in a black sedan, just as the clock strikes 22:00. When you enter the car, immediately scan for the green light on the rearview mirror—it signals the car is clear of bugs. Deliver the intel from the microchip, but only when you're certain there’s no listening device nearby.

    Phase 4: Escape Route
    Once the intel is delivered, you have 5 minutes to disappear. Use the underground tunnel that runs beneath the warehouse. Exit at Sector B, where your secondary transport will be waiting. Destroy any comms devices immediately after exiting. Trust nothing after 23:00—the enemy will have set up false trails.

Be vigilant. The enemy knows we're moving. Use decoy signals to throw them off your scent. Do not attempt contact until the mission is complete. They are monitoring all incoming signals, and even one slip-up could lead to compromise.

Good luck, Agent.

Your loyalty is your greatest weapon.
